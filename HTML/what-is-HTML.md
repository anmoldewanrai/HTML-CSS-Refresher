# So what is HTML?

- A markup language used to structure a web page and its content.
- Series of elements used to wrap/enclose different parts of the content to display it in a certain way.
- The enclosing tags (that form an element) can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.

## Example:
### Normal Te
> My cat is very grumpy

Enclosing the above line in a `<p></p>` element.
> <p>My cat is very grumpy</p>
