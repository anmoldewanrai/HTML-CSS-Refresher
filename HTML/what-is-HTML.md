### What is HTML?

- A markup language used to structure a web page and its content.
- Series of elements used to wrap/enclose different parts of the content to display it in a certain way.
- The enclosing tags (that form an element) can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.

## Anatomy of an HTML Element:

> <p>Hello, World!</p>

1. The **opening tag**: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.
2. The **closing tag**: Same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. 
3. The **content**: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.
4. The **element**: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.
